This is where the data from FRIDA's sensitivity runs should exist. The user can download the zip file (_UA_EMBv6Try2_nS100000.zip_) from (<a href="#">https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1T57YM_WiT4wA1QeLBbgLYLvRGtacB-O3</a>), and extract the subfolder plotData (from figures/CI-plots/equalyWeighted within the unzipped file) as plotData_EMB in this folder.

In addition, user needs the calibration data, which is to be downloaded (<a href="#">https://github.com/metno/WorldTransFRIDA/blob/main/Data/Calibration%20Data.csv</a>) and placed in this folder.
